Tim. Tim is a frog. Tim is on his way home from CS400 class and he is trying to make his way to the pond where he will meet his xTeam to finish their program.
However, Tim is new to campus and forgot how to get to the pond. It is getting
very late and his xTeam is getting very worried about him.

An unfamiliar voice said only these words and then the world went black. I was
born into this dark world given no name, no purpose. Nothing. How am I to live
in such a condition? What is there to do? Do I sit here for eternity in 
solemn silence, or revolt? Revolt? Against whom? And if I sit here, what do
I think about? Can I even sit? Can I think? What do I do? Do I even exist?
I'm not sure how to answer these questions, or where they are coming from.
Mostly, I just want to know my purpose and why I was created. Who am I?
