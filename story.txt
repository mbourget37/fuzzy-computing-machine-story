I have no idea what to write in here. Something about a character and a
setting.

An unfamiliar voice said only these words and then the world went black. I was
born into this dark world given no name, no purpose. Nothing. How am I to live
in such a condition? What is there to do? Do I sit here for eternity in 
solemn silence, or revolt? Revolt? Against whom? And if I sit here, what do
I think about? Can I even sit? Can I think? What do I do? Do I even exist?
I'm not sure how to answer these questions, or where they are coming from.
Mostly, I just want to know my purpose and why I was created. Who am I?
