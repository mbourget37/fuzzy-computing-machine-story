Tim. Tim is a frog. Tim is on his way home from CS400 class and he is trying to make his way to the pond where he will meet his xTeam to finish their program.
However, Tim is new to campus and forgot how to get to the pond. It is getting
very late and his xTeam is getting very worried about him.

An unfamiliar voice said only these words and then the world went black. I was
born into this dark world given no name, no purpose. Nothing. How am I to live
in such a condition? What is there to do? Do I sit here for eternity in 
solemn silence, or revolt? Revolt? Against whom? And if I sit here, what do
I think about? Can I even sit? Can I think? What do I do? Do I even exist?
I'm not sure how to answer these questions, or where they are coming from.
Mostly, I just want to know my purpose and why I was created. Who am I?

An entity that could not be described with English words approached Tim. This 
strange entity told Tim that him that he must make it back home, but before 
he does that, he will tell Tim his purpose. The entity tells Tim that he is a 
frog. His purpose is to hop around, eat, sleep, and reproduce. He tells him
that he is just another creature in the universe whose sole purpose is to live
on this planet. However, he adds that because this is his purpose, he must 
give a purpose to his own life.

With his newfound wisdom, Tim became filled with joy because he now knew the 
purpose of what is called life. He joyfully leaped home whilst hi-fiving many 
strangers on the sidewalk. He then proceded to fulfill the purpose that the 
entity had bestowed upon him. First he slept. Second he ate a nice split 
pea soup. And Lastly, he started his family and was gifted a son whom he 
named Timothy. His life was very average after that.
The End.
